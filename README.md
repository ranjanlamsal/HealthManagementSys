food and exercise tracking code
In that main.py
in in_food() and in_exe() function if if the file doesnot exist then it creates a new file with some initial information
and during the same execution if we wanted to add info then the second content overwrite the first one. Hence file if created but the initial
information is not posted. To resolve that i have to exit the code after creating a new profile(txt file) and again execute it for adding info.
